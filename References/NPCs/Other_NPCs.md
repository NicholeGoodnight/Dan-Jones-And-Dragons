# Major NPCs

## Bartholomew, Talking Skull

A talking skull bought by Coil from Karshala. How he became a talking skull is unknown, but it is likely the work of a necromancer. He is fully aware of his predicament and desires to travel with the Party.

## Valss, Hobson's Patron

Valss seems to have lived in Orlon years ago as part of an adventuring group. His memories are shrouded in mystery, but he gets flashes in the Flesh Cave. He currently lives in the silver bracer on Hobson's arm, which allows him to control Hobson if he so desires. His greatest desire is to get a statue of himself, which is why he is bonded with Hobson.

Presumably the head of the Bloodletters guild that Morenthal and Molloke are a part of. It is unclear what he thinks of everything going on.
