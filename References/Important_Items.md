# Important & Notable Items

## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karshala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karshala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karshala. The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks.

### Feyli's Music Box

A seemingly ordinary Music Box that Feyli continuously forgets she has. She alone is confused by not having seen it before, despite showing to the Party multiple times. (Such forgetful properties are refered to as "antimemetic")

### Trilby's Bag of Many Things

A bag that creates a new available item once a day. It was gifted to Trilby by Biggleton Whippersnap along with the Brass Puzzle. In turn, Trilby is supposed to give Whippersnap some items from the bag.

### Trilby's Brass Puzzle

A deviously complex puzzle that had to be solved before Trilby could access his Bag of Many Things. After a few days, Trilby managed to crack open the puzzle (which had a DC 25 INT check). 

### Hobson's Adamantine Shortsword

A shortsword found among the personal effects of the Missing People. Originally discovered by Morenthal, it was given to Hobson for keeping, and it has since become his pact weapon. It deals Crit damage to objects.

## Bag of Many Things Pulls

A scale from a Green Dragon that is larger than Trilby's fist. Dragon scales are known for their durability, so perhaps this could be used for something in the future.
