# Important & Notable Items

## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karshala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karshala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karshala. 

### Feyli's Music Box

A seemingly ordinary Music Box that Feyli continuously forgets she has. She alone is confused by not having seen it before, despite showing to the Party multiple times. (Such forgetful properties are refered to as "antimemetic")

### Trilby's Bag of Many Things

A bag that creates a new available item once a day. It was gifted to Trilby by Biggleton Whippersnap along with the Brass Puzzle. In turn, Trilby is supposed to give Whippersnap some items from the bag.

### Trilby's Brass Puzzle

A deviously complex puzzle that had to be solved before Trilby could access his Bag of Many Things. After a few dayys, Trilby managed to crack open the puzzle (which had a DC 25 INT check). 

### Hobson's Milk of the Poppy Potion

A draught of sleeping potion that was purchased at the Serpent's Flower. Hobson was potentially going to use it to avoid being possessed by Valss constantly.

### Hobson's Adamantine Shortsword

A shortsword found among the personal effects of the Missing People. Originally discovered by Morenthal, it was given to Hobson for keeping. The sword is Adamantine, making every hit attack count as a critical hit.

## Other Items

### Sending Stone

One of the stones used to communicate within the tunnel from Filgrove to Geria. The other was with the original party that is MIA.

### Book of Necromancy

The book that Gale Mosswing used to improve his farm's standing, to the detriment of his family and the Missing People. It was given by Dave the Necromancer.

### Relic Staff

A powerful artifact that originally came from Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel. It is believed to be in the tunnel between Filgrove and Geria, and it must be retrieved.

### Orb of Recall

A one-time return button that is meant to bring anyone within 10 ft of the orb back to a location. It functions as the Teleport Circle spell, returning those within the active radius to the Filgrove Barraks's Teleportation Circle once used.
