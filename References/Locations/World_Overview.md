# The Continent of Orlon

Not much has been revealed about the continent as a whole. It appears to be controlled by an Empire, and is militarily served by the Crown's Guard. Smaller sections of the continent may be under control of Dukes. Most of the Party's adventures take place in the North of Orlon, around Filgrove.

## Major Cities/Locations

### Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures take shape. It is home to several services that the Party utilizes, and it is looked over by the Crown's Guard and the Green Ravens. Although not much happens around the city, both groups are looking for additional help constnatly. Notable locations in and around Filgrove include the following:

### The Flesh Cave

A corrupted structure deep within the Underdark. The Relic Staff was found here and used unsucessfully in a ritual for the Brood Mother. The result was a fleshy corruption that overtook and partially destroyed the structure. The Crown's Guard failed to retrieve the Staff, but the Party managed to do so. Without the staff, the flesh should hopefully rot away into nothingness.

## Minor Cities/Locations

### Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack caused several of such artifacts to be spread around Orlon. The Crown's Guard has been tasked with recovering these artifacts. The Relic Staff is one such artifact that was lost and since recovered.

### Geria

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft.

### Maple

A town to the Southeast where Hobson's family lives. Maple Farms is a brand of wine. Almost nothing else is known about it.

### Morfield

A town not too far to the south of Filgrove. It appears to be the most recent stop for the Illustrious Delight before they went to Filgrove.

### Northcliff

A presumably floating city on account of Green Void Crystals. It is south of Filgrove, but beyond that, almost nothing is known. 

### Ravenmire

A town even further North than Filgrove. Even less happens there, so almost nothing is known.

### Scarlan/Nightmother Temple

Scarlan used to be a tiny village, but it had a Temple to the Nightmother. This was the Party's first adventure, as they discovered Dave the necromancer living in the catacombs below the Temple. 

### Sibera

A decently large city in the Underdark filled with Duergar and insectoids. Duergar are underground dwarves that presumably don't like outsiders. The Miners and Party have been told to avoid the city by the Crown's Guard.

### Silverfell

A town in the West of Orlon that is home to a mage college of some kind. Hobson was originally supposed to join the college as an administrator before meeting Valss.

### Springoak

A town on the Western edge of Orlon. Almost nothing is known other than Hobson is likely a wanted man thanks to Valss.

### Void Cave

A large cave filled with Void Crystals that was home to the Void Snail. It is about 2 days travel to the West of Filgrove. The Party killed the Void Snail, taking chunks back to create new items.

## Other Regions

### The Shard Coast

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here. Whoever put the bounty on Morenthal is in this area.

### Shareaza

Presumably a large town across the East Sea (which means it may not be on Orlon proper). It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Almost nothing is known about it otherwise.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness, including mutant spider monsters and mushroom creatures. A few cities are found down below, though getting there requires long, trecherous journeys.
