## Personal Items

### Coil's Dowsing Rod

An item purchased from Karshala the Hag. It is able to judge distances and direction to determine where an item is. It appears to act like the *Locate Object* spell.

### Coil's Void Greatsword

A greatsword that Oldair of the Green Ravens will craft. It will likely have magic dispelling properties when completed.

### Feyli's Deck of Cards

An item gotten from Karshala the Hag in exchange for a favor. It appears to be a fancy tarot deck of 20 cards, though Jocat believes it to be a Deck of Many Things. The favor in turn was to give the Relic Staff to Karshala. The first card pulled was Wheel of Fortune, causing Feyli to have Disadvantage on attacks & skill checks. The second card was The Tower, resulting in her sinking into her surroundings ever so slightly.

### Feyli's Music Box

A seemingly ordinary Music Box that Feyli continuously forgets she has. She alone is confused by not having seen it before, despite showing to the Party multiple times. (Such forgetful properties are refered to as "antimemetic")

### Gelnek's Dragon Scale Button

A gift from Trilby carved from the Dragon Scale he pulled from his Bag of Many Things. It grants a +1 to AC and Resistance against Poison damage while atttuned.

### Hobson's Adamantine Shortsword

A shortsword found among the personal effects of the Missing People. Originally discovered by Morenthal, it was given to Hobson for keeping, and it has since become his pact weapon. It deals Crit damage to objects.

### Hobson's Milk of the Poppy Potion

A draught of sleeping potion that was purchased at the Serpent's Flower. Hobson was potentially going to use it to avoid being possessed by Valss constantly.

### Hobson's Cloak of Protection

A purple cloak that used to belong to a Crown's Guard member. It was found in the Flesh Cave. After attuning to it, Hobson gains a +1 to AC.

### Morenthal's Void Headband

A headband Oldair of the Green Ravens will craft. It will likely have magic resistant properties when completed.

### Morenthal's Void Leather Armor

Leather armor Oldair of the Green Ravens will craft. It will likely have magic resistant properties when completed.

### Trilby's Bag of Many Things

A bag that creates a new available item once a day. It was gifted to Trilby by Biggleton Whippersnap along with the Brass Puzzle. In turn, Trilby is supposed to give Whippersnap some items from the bag. (Pulls are listed in Important_Items)

### Trilby's Brass Puzzle

A deviously complex puzzle that had to be solved before Trilby could access his Bag of Many Things. After a few days, Trilby managed to crack open the puzzle (which had a DC 25 INT check).
