# Dungeon Master: Dan Jones

# The Party; Current Level: 4

## Coil the Beast Barbarian (He/Him)

### Played by Saren (They/Them)

A Warforged with the head of jackal whose jaws are often locked up tight. Serves as the Party's greatest muscle and shield. Protective of all members of the Party, especially Feyli. Prefers to use his claws and mouth in combat, but carries a large sword as well.

## Feyli the Circle of the Stars Druid (She/Her)

### Played by Nichole (She/Her)

A tanned Tiefling with branch-like horns adorned with flowers and a tail wrapped in thorns. She has purple hair and an outfit suggestign an affinity for nature. She is a part of the Midnight Lotus with a crystal necklace to prove it. Enjoys other people's drama so long as nobody gets physically hurt.

## Gelnek the Valor Bard (He/Him)

### Played by Jocat (He/Him)

A heavy set Goblin carrying a large drum and mace maracas. If it weren't for his green skin, he could easily be mistaken for a gangly dwarf. Declared to be double leader of the Party after defeating Feyli and Morenthal in an arm wrestling contest. Follows Aether the Breaker, and his tribe is the O'stanke.

## Hobson Bunce the Warlock (He/Him)

### Played by Dan Floyd (He/Him)

A Halfling who looks like Ernie from Sesame Street. Has some light leather armor and a silver bracer. His (homebrewed) patron is Valss, and the two are on a mission to get Valss a statue. Hobson and Valss don't exactly know what's going on most of the time, so they follow the Party happily. Valss can also take control of Hobson if needed.

## Morenthal the Assassin Rogue (He/They)

### Played by Gamb (He/They)

A Drow that hasn't quite warmed up to the Party quite yet. He is/was part of a Guild of rogues/assassins, though his past is shrouded in mystery. He too has a necklace representing his faction, though said faction is unknown. Wears black and leather, serving as the traditional edgy rogue.

## Trilby the Artillerist Artificer (He/Him)

### Played by Barry (He/Him)

A soft, pampered Human who is both brilliant and laughably weak at the same time. The Party is most willing to protect this man and his Eldritch Cannon named Scrubbins. Trilby has very little experience with the world outside of Filgrove, so many of the Party's experiences are shockers to him and his sense of justice in the world.
