# The Continent of Orlon

Not much has been revealed about the continent as a whole. It appears to be controlled by an Empire, and is militarily served by the Crown's Guard. Smaller sections of the continent may be under control of Dukes. Most of the Party's adventures take place in the North of Orlon, around Filgrove.

## Major Cities/Locations

### Filgrove

Filgrove is where the Party spends most of their time. It is a decent sized city in the North of Orlon, serving as a defensive city in the past. In and around the city, the Party's early adventures take shape. It is home to several services that the Party utilizes, and it is looked over by the Crown's Guard and the Green Ravens. Although not much happens around the city, both groups are looking for additional help constnatly. Notable locations in and around Filgrove include the following:

#### Bits and Bobs

A pawn shop run by Biggleton Whippersnap. Trilby is given the Bag of Many Things covered by the Brass Puzzle by Whippersnap.

#### The Brass Squid

The Party's main tavern where they all first met. It is headed by Gavel along with his employees Derek and Merra. Gavel is happy to accomodate the Party after they saved Derek from the Manticore. This place is a safe haven where the Party can rest, get rations and eat good food.

#### The Crown's Guard Tower

One of the offices of the Crown's Guard that serves the city. Usually manned by Borey. The Crown's Guard is stretched thin this far North, so Borey is appreciative of any help the Party can give him.

#### The Grayhorn Farm

One of the two main farms outside of town. It is run solely by Terry Grayhorn after his son Bren Grayhorn went missing. Due to the lack of funds and help, the farm is slowly being out-done by the Mosswing farm. They are famous for carrots, though they farm all kinds of produce.

#### The Green Raven's Headquarters

The monster hunting Green Ravens have set themselves up here. It is where they eat, sleep, prepare for hunts, and salvage items from their other hunts. The Party is offered space in the HQ thanks to their services to Filgrove as a whole. Monster hunts can be exchanged for money or forged into gear. 

#### The Mosswing Farm

One of the two main farms outside of town. It is headed by Gale Mosswing, who managed to greatly improve his crop production. Unfortunately, this was through the use of dark magics and necromancy. This resulted in the Missing People incident.

#### The Serpent's Flower

This alchemist's store is run solely by Jemma Elm, though her daughter Joyce also used to work there. Various potions can be bought here once the Party gets enough money, including a sleeping drought for Hobson. 

#### The Undercroft

The Undercroft serves as the slums for Filgrove. It is located under the city, though it is nicer than the sewers. The notable resident here is Karshala the Hag, who deals in information and magical trinkets. Furthermore, a tunnel to Geria starts down here.

#### What's Mine is Mine

The miners of Filgrove are headed by Pibbly Glimbsby, and they serve to gather resources around the town. Their services were also requested by the Crown's Guard to map the tunnels to Geria. 

## Minor Cities/Locations

### Brightcoin, the Vaults of Eversteel

A major and secure vault containing several artifacts. An attack caused several of such artifacts to be spread around Orlon. The Crown's Guard has been tasked with recovering these artifacts.

### Geria

A dwarven island in the North and West part of Orlon. Not much is known about it other than a tunnel supposedly exists between it and Filgrove's Undercroft.

### Ravenmire

A town even further North than Filgrove. Even less happens there, so almost nothing is known.

### Scarlan/Nightmother Temple

Scarlan used to be a tiny village, but it had a Temple to the Nightmother. This was the Party's first adventure, as they discovered Dave the necromancer living in the catacombs below the Temple. 

### Springoak

A town on the Western edge of Orlon. Almost nothing is known other than Hobson is likely a wanted man thanks to Valss.

## Other Regions

### The Shard Coast

A series of ports, coves, and towns that serve as a pirate's haven on the North East part of Orlon. If there is someone unsavory that needs to be found, you could start in a lot worse places than here.

### Shareaza

Presumably a large town across the East Sea (which means it may not be on Orlon proper). It is supposed to have some "Fated Steps" that Bartholomew wanted to visit. Almost nothing is known about it otherwise.

### The Underdark

The Underdark is the deep underground portions of a D&D world. The tunnel from Filgrove to Geria likely passes through such a region. It is home to all kinds of creatures adapted for the darkness.
