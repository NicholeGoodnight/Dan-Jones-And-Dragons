# Major NPCs

## Bartholomew, Talking Skull

A talking skull bought by Coil from Karshala. How he became a talking skull is unknown, but it is likely the work of a necromancer. He is fully aware of his predicament and desires to travel with the Party.

## Borey, Crown's Guard Captain

A Dwarf that previously was pestered constantly by Trilby. He acts as the captain of Filgrove's Crown's Guard. He was also friends/captain of Trilby's father before the father got injured. Commissions the Party to do a few jobs when available.

## Gavel, Tavern Keep

The keeper of the Brass Squid tavern. He is grateful for the Party saving Derek at their beginnings. From then on, his tavern has always welcomed the Party with a room and good food for resting.

## Hestio, Green Raven Leader

The de facto leader of the Green Ravens was first impressed by the Party taking down the Manticore. Since then, he has seen the Party as a capable bunch, and he extended an invitation into the Green Raven's ranks for them. He and Borey are the Party's go-tos for any authorities. He is also the best at breaking down monster parts into useable items.

## Karshala, the Hag

A Hag that lives in Filgrove's Undercroft. She deals in information and magical curiosities. If there is something the Party (or anyone else) needs to know, she is probably their best bet. Her trinkets may come in handy in some situations.

## Valss, Hobson's Patron

Not much is known about Valss other than his connection to Hobson. He lives in the silver bracer on Hobson's arm, which allows him to control Hobson if he so desires. His greatest desire is to get a statue of himself, which is why he is bonded with Hobson.

# Worldbuilding NPCs

## Aether the Breaker

The deity that Gelnek prays to, and presumably another member of the Nine. His domain likely involves destruction, warfare, and calamities.

## The Duke

Presumably the main authority over Filgrove and the northern region at large. There is no name nor actions given so far. Borey claims the Crown's Guard can get a favor for the Party if needed.

## The Flame Tyrant

A figure from Orlon's recent history that is obsessed with fire. Has a small following known as the Burning Spears, though nothing else is known.

## The Nightmother

One of the Nine that makes up this world's pantheon. Little is known about what her domain is, but it is presumably something that is strongly against necromancy.
