## Session 8

During Dan J.'s recap, it is revealed that Illustrious Delight is a part of the Midnight Lotus, rather than the Black Hand directly. Trilby is still fast asleep in his house, completely oblivious to whatever is going down at the Brass Squid. With that aside, we open back in the tavern, Feyli and Coil upstairs, Morenthal, Gelnek, and Hobson still downstairs. Gelnek rushes upstairs to talk with Feyli and Coil about what happened with his conversation with the Illustrious Delight. Coil is confused, and Feyli is still drunk, so it doesn't go especially well. Coil says that the best thing is for everyone to regroup downstairs, so they all start going back down to the bar. The crew of Illustrious Delight is twitchy and ready to strike, but they don't do anything just yet. Morenthal tries to give Gavel a look and gesture, trying to give a warning. Gavel undertands this time, calling Derek and Merra to "help with something in the back." About four other civilians are in the bar right now, not paying attention to what's going on right now. Gelnek is sent by Morenthal to try to get the other civilians out of the bar. The first table has a pair of dwarves playing checkers, and Gelnek acts like a madman. This successfully gets the dwarves and the other table to leave, as they all want no part of whatever just happened.

Now that it is only the Party and Illustrious Delight in the bar area, Morenthal asks if the Party is ready. As he says that, Sawyer comes along and tugs on Coil's cloak. He tries to initiate a conversation, saying that it would be a shame to ruin the establishment. During this, Feyli was watching the stairs, waiting for Ember to show herself. Ember has made her way over to the railing upstairs, watching everything from the balcony. Morenthal asks what is there to talk about, also noticing Ember on the balcony. Sawyer says that he thinks the Party wants to fight the Illustrious Delight. Feyli looks directly at Ember and pointedly asks what *is* going on. Valss says that he thought Ember and he were hitting it off, and Feyli tells him to shut up. *(Note: Valss controls Hobson for much longer than before. As such, anything Hobson does is attributed to Valss instead. Other characters refer to Valss as Hobson still.)* Ember comes down the stairs, and asks the same question back: What *is* going on? Ember points out that basically nobody in the Party knows what could possibly be going on, and as Feyli approaches says she is feeling threatened. Ember grabs Feyli's costume and pulls her close, whispering that Feyli knows what Ember wants, so she should give it back. Feyli doesn't know, so the two of them go back and forth. Eventually Ember says that Feyli has **The First**'s Heart, which is why everyone cares that she's here. Feyli maintains that she doesn't know what Ember is talking about. Ember makes eye contact with the Illustrious Delight table, and they all stand up.

Morenthal tries to intervene, by saying that a lot of miscommunication is going on, a lot of people are in the dark, so the right thing to do is sit back down and talk about what the heck is going on. Sawyer seems to like that idea, so he pulls up a chair and sits down in it where he currently is. Thee rest of the Party and Illustrious Delight grab chairs and circle around one of the large round tables. Morenthal starts by saying his name and that he's known the Party for a very short amount of time. He points to Sawyer to go next. Sawyer introduces himself as Sawyer Glitterpocket, leader of the Illustrious Delight travelling circus. Morenthal gestures to Feyli and Ember staring daggers at each other, asking what all that is about. Sawyer claims that Feyli took something valuable to their organization, and they have come to get it back. Feyli maintains that she didn't take anything, and Ember counters by asking why she thinks there's such a massive bounty on her head. Feyli still says she doesn't know and asks what they think she took other than herself. Ember repeats that Feyli took The First's Heart. The First is the **Unknown Leader** with respect to Feyli's backstory. Morenthal asks why they are so sure about Feyli having it, and Ember says that Feyli was the last to be with the First. At the time the First had a heart, and when Feyli fled, he didn't anymore. As a high ranking member, that is highly unusual for someone.

Feyli says that she doesn't have the heart, and nobody even knew she was in the room with the First. Morenthal asks if anyone else could have the heart, assuming the hypothetical that Feyli doesn't have the Heart. Feyli blurbs about someone else being in the room with her and the First. Sawyer says that while the person isn't here, he does have someone who could fact check Feyli's story, if the Party allows. Morenthal quickly says that one of the Party should come along to ensure that Sawyer isn't just getting a bunch of people to strong arm the Party, and Sawyer says that said option is fair. Sawyer goes over and grabs Hobson, saying that the same size is fair, and Hobson agrees. Sawyer tells the group to not do anything rash, before he and Hobson leave the tavern. Hobson and Sawyer go walking into the second district, towards the temple of The Nine, keeping conversation with Hobson. He doesn't seem to hold a grudge against anyone except Feyli specifically. About 200 ft from the chruch, Sawyer tells Hobsont that what he's going to see would best be kept secret. Valss agrees to keep the secret, so Sawyer leads him into the graveyard. There, the Dwarf Feyli saw earlier opens a grave, pulls out a body, and throws it into a wheelbarrow. Sawyer asks if he could use the Dwarf's skills for a minute, and he follows along. The three of them head back to the tavern.

Meanwhile, back at the tavern, the Illustrious Delight group is tense and eyeing up the Party. Coil asks about what the Heart actually is, like human or whatnot. Ember says that the First is higher than mortals, so he's not human, not that she's seen him. Feyli counters by asking if Ember hasn't seen the first, how does she know that he doesn't have a Heart anymore. Ember simply replies that even Feyli doesn't know who's the boss's boss. Ember says that the main reason that everyone isn't fighting right now is beecause Filgrove is important to the troupe as a bank. (OOC) Feyli recalls that "bank" refers to more obscure towns prone to young deaths, taking and replacing the bodies every few years. Gelnek questions how bringing the Heart back would help if the First is already dead. Ember says that the Party really doesn't know anything about Feyli at all. She proceeds to say that the organization doesn't consider death to be the end, and they thrive on it. Being incomplete without the Heart is more important than being dead. With not much other conversation to do, all of them wait for Hobson, the Dwarf, and Sawyer to get back. Sawyer introduces the Dwarf as Gorm, asking him to do his thing on Feyli, since she seems confused. Gorm nods, but Coil wants to know exactly what Gorm is about to do, and Gorm says something about no lies. Sawyer confirms that if Feyli is telling the truth, then the Illustrious Delight doesn't have any issue with her.

Gorm proceeds to cast a Zone of Truth, and only Morenthal saves. Sawyer asks Feyli if she has or otherwise knows the whereabouts of the First's Heart. Feyli replies that she doesn't. Sawyer gives a side glance at Ember, asking if she stole it, but Feyli once again says she didn't steal it. With those answers, Sawyer says that the Illustrious Delight has no beef with Feyli anymore. Morenthal, releived, asks Ember if they are going to leave the Party alone now. Ember says that the group here won't bother the Party, and Feyli gets Ember to say that it includes herself. Ember now says that the group just wants to leave and maintain their good reputation in Filgrove. It won't solve the bounty situation, but that's Feyli's problem. Morenthal is curious as to why the gorup wants to maintain their reputation. Ember says that it is because of the bank situation in the town, and with a nod from Sawyer, says that they take their dead. Coil and Morenthal are utterly confused, and Ember repeats that Feyli hasn't told the Party anything. Ember explains that The First is better known as The First Dead, and the organization serves him because they want to restore him to the status he once had. Necromancers, in short. The bodies are for whatever the organization needs them for, and Feyli retorts that if they don't get enough, then they just make more. Coil asks if this is why Feyli left, and she says that the reason is complicated. Morenthal and Hobson say that it probably isn't becuase Ember just listed a bunch of great reasons to leave. Feyli says that she left beause the organization is full of liars, and that is all the Party needs to know.

Morenthal pushes Feyli to give more reasoning, but Feyli continues to be tight lipped, saying that the reasons she workd for them are for her alone to know. The organization will do whatever they need to do for themselves and only themselves. Sawyer nods in agreement to Feyli's accusations. One of the half-elves asks if they can go, because he probably isn't supposed to hear all of this. Gorm ends his concentration on the Zone of Truth and leaves the tavern to head back to the graveyard. Coil says that future attempts to attack Feyli won't be take kindly. Sawyer says that while he doesn't want to fight Coil, but he hopes the Party understands why the organization would be after her. Morenthal tells them to tell the rest of the organization about what happened here, and Sawyer says that he'll take care of the troupe, but can't get the organization to change its mind. The Illustrious Delights will stay out of it unless their reputation is sullied. Tesen thanks Gelnek for the compliments and the stories as the whole troupe leaves the tavern. Gavel pokes his head out from behind the door and asks if everyone's done. He tells Derek and Merra to go home for the night. Gelnek pays for the two tables' tabs plus one. Several minutes pass, but the troup doesn't return.

Morenthal simply goes upstairs and goes into his room. Gelnek goes up to Feyli and say that working with a necromancer must have been difficult, and everyone has secrets and reasons for keeping those secrets. Gelnek will need to think about Feyli's past. Valss, who has been extremely quiet during the whole thing, simply tells the Party good night and struggles to find his room. Feyli tells Coil that she didn't know anyone took the First's Heart, not that she cares. Coil says that it's probably for the best because necromancers are bad. Coil says that now he knows why people are after Feyli rather that just knowing that people were after her. Feyli assumed it was for her knowledge of the organization, but now she knows why as well. Feyli asks what Coil knows about the Midnight Lotus, but Coil doesn't know much except that it is surprising that it is associated with The First Dead, since Coil knows more about the Black Hand. Feyli explains to Coil how the Midnight Lotus works: The First is at the top, but nobody's seen him. **The Second** is the apprentice, and the two of them give orders. Below them are other apprentices, counting down. Feyli was a part of the Fourth level, thus known as Feyli the Fourth. One night, she decided to leave. Feyli then says that they should go up to sleep. Coil mentions that Feyli was ready to kill Ember, and Feyli confirms that she would kill anyone of the Midnight Lotus without remorse. Everyone goes to sleep.

Valss makes his way back to Morenthal and Gelnek's room, releasing his control over Hobson inside the room. Hobson asks the two of them what happened, confirms that everyone is fine, and decides to worry about this later. Feyli takes another WIS save during the night, having a perfectly peaceful night. Morning sees Filgrove a little hungover but getting back awake. The Illustrious Delight have moved on from the town, but everything else seems to go on as normal. Gelnek decides to call a Party meeting, and Trilby makes his way back to the tavern. Morenthal resists giong to the meeting, so Gelnek is forced to cancel the Party meeting. Hobson is worried about what he missed last night, so he, Coil, Morenthal, and Gelnek head downstairs for breakfast. Gelnek chooses to have a mini Party meeting, allowing anyone to share secrets due to what happened last night. [Pause: 1:27:00]
